# Advanced CSS & SCSS Course
This is me trying to learn practical applications of SCSS "The superpowered CSS", CSS Flexbox, and CSS Grid. I am learning these from one of the Udemy courses [https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/) by __Jonas Schmedtmann__.

I will be updating this repository with the projects that I will do while completing the course.
